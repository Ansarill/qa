      "[{'answer_id': 94666, 'body': '<h3>Moral luck</h3>\\n<p>You have raised the issue of <em>moral luck</em>, a long recognized problem in criminal theory. The classic expositions of this issue are by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Nagel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thomas Nagel</a>, in his chapter, &quot;<a href=\"https://rintintin.colorado.edu/%7Evancecd/phil1100/Nagel1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moral Luck</a>&quot; (1979) and <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Williams\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bernard Williams</a>, &quot;<a href=\"https://bibliotecamathom.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/williams_-_moral_luck.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moral Luck</a>&quot; (1976). Specifically, you are describing what they call <em>outcome</em> luck, or <em>consequential</em> luck.</p>\\n<p>Driving while intoxicated vs. driving while intoxicated and causing death is not the only example where moral luck results in a distinction in punishment. Other examples are:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>dangerous driving vs. dangerous driving that causes death</li>\\n<li>a successful offence vs. an attempted offence (generally resulting in a maximum sentence less than that of the successful offence)</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Nagel writes:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>If someone has had too\\nmuch to drink and his car swerves on to the sidewalk, he can count himself morally lucky if there are no pedestrians in its path. If there were, he would\\nbe to blame for their deaths, and would probably be prosecuted for\\nmanslaughter. But if he hurts no one, although his recklessness is exactly the\\nsame, he is guilty of a far less serious legal offence and will certainly reproach\\nhimself and be reproached by others much less severely. To take another legal\\nexample, the penalty for attempted murder is less than that for successful\\nmurder – however similar the intentions and motives of the assailant may be\\nin the two cases. His degree of culpability can depend, it would seem, on\\nwhether the victim happened to be wearing a bullet-proof vest, or whether a\\nbird flew into the path of the bullet – matters beyond his control.</p>\\n<p>...</p>\\n<p>... How is it possible to be more or less culpable depending\\non whether a child gets into the path of one’s car, or a bird into the path of\\none’s bullet? Perhaps it is true that what is done depends on more than the\\nagent’s state of mind or intention. The problem then is, why is it not irrational to base moral assessment on what people do, in this broad sense? It\\namounts to holding them responsible for the contributions of fate as well as\\nfor their own – provided they have made some contribution to begin with. ... If the object of moral judgment is the person, then to hold him accountable for what he has done in the broader sense is akin to strict liability, which may have its legal uses but seems irrational as a moral position.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h3>Two offered justifications for making distinctions based purely on outcome</h3>\\n<p>Two considerations often raised as justification for differential treatment based on outcome are (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Enoch_(philosopher)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">David Enoch</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrei_Marmor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Andrei Marmor</a>, &quot;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/27652623\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Case against Moral Luck</a>&quot;, 26 LAW &amp; PHIL. 405 (2007), pp. 415–17)</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>epistemological / evidential — the person who <em>actually</em> killed a person was more likely to have been driving more recklessly</li>\\n<li>the theory that the actor should have to internalize the risk, fully, when they set out on a risky activity — if they happen to kill someone, the risk of this higher punishment was part of what they should have accounted for when deciding to embark on the risky activity</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>A couple of quotes from Enoch and Marmor:</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>All other things being equal, the occurrence of an accident is plausibly considered as at least some prima facie evidence for recklessness, or indeed for a higher\\ndegree of recklessness.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>A conception of fairness that requires\\nagents to internalize the costs of their risky activities does not\\nnecessarily reflect a view of responsibility or blameworthiness.\\nIt may simply reflect a judgment about the appropriate distribution of the costs of risky activities.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n', 'score': 72}, {'answer_id': 94674, 'body': '<p>Drunk driving remains, per se, &quot;victimless&quot; - a breach of regulations - until someone actually becomes a victim.

Then, if they kill the murderer, the murderer's family might seek revenge for his death.

Since it doesn't necessarily cause harm, it doesn't really make sense to punish it as severely as something which does cause harm. To prevent harm is one of the main reasons laws exist in the first place, so whether harm was or would've been caused is an important consideration.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<p>Drunk driving can be compared to some degree to driving while medicated. Medicine affects different people differently under different circumstances, so it wouldn't really make sense to say driving after taking a single aspirin is equivalent to driving after taking strong prescription pain pills, or that taking something which has no noticeable effect on you is bad because it knocks someone else out.</p>\\n<p>The difference is that alcohol has a more consistent effect, it's a more common known source of accidents, and it's easier to test for.</p>\\n\", 'score': 0}, {'answer_id': 94739, 'body': '<h2>Harming someone, or being drunker, offers different facts that violate more laws.</h2>\\n<p>It\\'s simple: if you do more stuff, you can violate more laws at the same time.

Without any signs of alcohol-related errors, you can have less than 0.5 permille.</li>\\n<li>Driving under the influence of alcohol in a manner that is noticeable for the intoxication, you gain a hefty fine when caught.
